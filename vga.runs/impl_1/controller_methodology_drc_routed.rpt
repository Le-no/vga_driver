The latch colors_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin colors_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch colors_reg[10] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin colors_reg[10]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch colors_reg[11] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin colors_reg[11]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch colors_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin colors_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch colors_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin colors_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch colors_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin colors_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/User/vga/vga.srcs/constrs_1/imports/constraints/zedboard_master_XDC_RevC_D_v2.xdc (Line: 79))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/User/vga/vga.srcs/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0_1/clk_wiz_0.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/User/vga/vga.srcs/constrs_1/imports/constraints/zedboard_master_XDC_RevC_D_v2.xdc (Line: 79))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/User/vga/vga.srcs/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0_1/clk_wiz_0.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>
